# Dex Challenge 

### Technologies 

- Linux, Ubuntu
- Python 3.12
- VS Code
- Git, Github
- Poetry
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL


### The roadmap so far...

- CLIs, interactive terminal menu, data aggregation and files:
1. Create a CLI that will receive the name of the pokedex file and provide answers for some questions.
2. The CLI that reads the file now will have an interactive terminal menu that will provide answers for some questions as the users selects the options.
3. The interactive terminal menu will log into files each action that the user selects and generate a final report of the information that the user request.

- Web:
1. Now you need to gather the pokemon information from the API https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2/pokemon and print some relevant info about the data in the terminal.
2. You need to gather the data from the inner urls that comes in each pokemon information, aggregate those information and show some relevant info about the data in the terminal.
3. After capture these data, store it in a database, and aggreagate the data from the database to show relevant information in the terminal.
4. Add a fastapi web framework to show the relevant aggregate data from the db in the browser.
5. Choose any client side language / framework to build a frontend for these data in the browser.

- To be continued...

### Data

During the whole challenge you will be using one data source, a pokedex.
All the data will come from this service: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
